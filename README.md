# Snake-Game
Objective: The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls of the game area or the snake's own body.
Snake Movement: The snake moves continuously in the game area. The player can control the direction of the snake's movement using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The snake can move up, down, left, or right.
Snake Growth: When the snake eats food, its length increases by one segment. The player earns points for each piece of food eaten.
Food Generation: Food appears randomly on the game canvas. When the snake eats a piece of food, a new piece of food is generated at a random location.
Boundary Wrapping: If the snake reaches the edge of the game area, it wraps around to the opposite side, allowing it to continue moving.
Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions between the snake's head and its body segments, as well as collisions with the walls of the game area. If the snake collides with itself or the walls, the game ends.
Score: The player's score increases each time the snake eats food. The score is displayed on the screen.
Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls. A "Game Over" message is displayed, and the player has the option to restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button.
